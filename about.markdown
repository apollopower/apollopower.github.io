I'm a computer programmer doing fun thing with **computer graphics** and **server-side development**.

My main interest is in understanding systems deeply to their full extent. The miracle of computing is that we have the ability to go from pixels to silicon in our quest to solve problems and create fresh, new ideas.

## The Early Years

I'm a native son of Miami, Florida. I spent the majority of my time messing with computers, video games, and playing music. In high school, I was convinced that I would become a professional Jazz musician. When I realized I could continue enjoying music without committing to it professionaly, I made the quick pivot that many of the lost and wandering make; go to business school.

## Breakthrough

As much as a hobby it was for me to write small scripts and mods for games, it never occured to me that people programmed computers for a living. Half way through business school, my friends and I start a web-based company and I realize that professional programming is actually a thing.

After going our separate ways *[(my friends now run a successful marketing agency)](https://www.ren.marketing/)* I dove into the world of computer programming and never looked back.

## Consulting, Banking, and Other Shenanigans

As a freshly minted "developer", I had to go prove my worth in the industry. I did web consulting, worked on digitial ad agency projects, and even worked on machine learning research projects for __[vagus nerve stimulation](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/vagus-nerve-stimulation/about/pac-20384565)__.

My first official big-time role was as a software engineer for JP Morgan's Energy Trading desk, where I sat on the trading floor across the traders, writing their software applications.

I had fun, learned a lot, got stressed (a lot), and above all, did my time on Wall Street.

## Seattle, WA

In 2020, I got the opportunity to move to Seattle and join ~~the Empire~~ Microsoft.

It was one of the best decisions I've ever made for my career and have had the opportunity to learn a lot from some excellent engineers and projects.

In the meantime, I also created **[Cognisell](https://www.cognisell.ai/)**, a sales training application for helping students based off my time in business school.
