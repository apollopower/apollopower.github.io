💭 **Top Thoughts**

My favorite coffee shop and roaster in Seattle is closing today. 

Thank you Elm Coffee Roasters for everything! I will miss the staff, the nice space to get work done, and of course the amazing coffee. 

✅ **Recently Done**

- Some new alpha features in Empwr.ai we are testing internally were published.
- Worked through a design exercise of what a linux-based home console (like a Steam machine?) could function.

🛠️ **Work Focus**

- More exciting Empwr.ai work.
- Some interesting problems to solve around sanitizing html input from email event descriptions that need to be solved.

🚴 **Training**

- Today is a rest day. Hoping to get some hard training done during the weekend.
